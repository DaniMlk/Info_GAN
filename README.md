# Info_GAN
#### In this repository I implement and reused Info_GAN to remove the artifact made by compression in different compresion level. The code is impelemented by python and using simple one image dataset with 4 level of compression. The output of generator generate image with better quality againt its input.

## Requirments
It is implemented by pytorch 0.3 and using Tensorboard to log the result.
</br>
## Usage
Use python main.py to run.
